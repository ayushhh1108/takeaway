        It is MoneyBucks’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any

        Policy applies to MoneyBucks.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
        "MoneyBucks.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
        protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
        through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
        Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,
        how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
        disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies

      <p className="mb-2">
        Like most website operators, MoneyBucks collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. MoneyBucks’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how MoneyBucks’s visitors use its
        website. From time to time, MoneyBucks may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        MoneyBucks also collects potentially personally-identifying information
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
        leaving comments on http://MoneyBucks.com blog posts. MoneyBucks only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.

        User Information

      <p className="mb-2">
        Certain visitors to MoneyBucks’s websites choose to interact with
        MoneyBucks in ways that require MoneyBucks to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that MoneyBucks gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
        example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://MoneyBucks.com
        to provide a username and email address.

        Protection of User Information
      </h4>
      <p className="mb-2">
        MoneyBucks discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on MoneyBucks’s behalf or to provide
        services available at MoneyBucks’s website, and (ii) that have agreed
        not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using MoneyBucks’s website, you consent to the transfer of such
        information to them. MoneyBucks will not rent or sell potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
        Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
        as described above, MoneyBucks discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
        response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
        when MoneyBucks believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to protect the property or rights of MoneyBucks, third parties
        or the public at large.

        If you are a registered user of http://MoneyBucks.com and have supplied
        your email address, MoneyBucks may occasionally send you an email to
        tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up
        to date with what’s going on with MoneyBucks and our products. We
        primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
        expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
        (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
        respond to your request or to help us support other users. MoneyBucks
        takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
        unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
